# üêª HMS Oski

The planning document for the (soon to be) first vessel to traverse Strawberry Creek.

## What is Strawberry Creek?

Strawberry Creek is a stream that runs through UC Berkeley:

In many ways it's the center of the campus and it's got a pretty interesting history. 

When there's a protest and Sather Gate is blocked, students have to go through Strawberry Creek to get to class:

## What does it mean to "traverse" Strawberry Creek?

Originally, I was going to define this as going from the start to the end of the main fork. However, I don't want to distrub the natural areas so instead I'm going to define the "start" as [the bridge just south of Moses Hall](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5gNNp6LmsLej8RKr5) and the end as [the bridge near Haas Pavilion](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ecUx1sd5Ywh5a3R78)

## What defines a boat?

* It must float.
* It must be possible for an adult human to sit in it.
* It must move in water.

## Why won't a normal boat work...

...well, Strawberry Creek is very very shallow and very rocky. At some points, there's basically no water in it. So we essentially will need to make a mini [DUKW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DUKW). Yes, that's a bit of a cop out but it's the only way.
